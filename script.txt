<b>About the course:</b> In this course students will engage with traditional models of composition studies via genre and mode, and can expect a hands-on approach to grappling with the complexities of drafting, writing, proofreading, and revision. Students can expect to confront a variety of texts and writing themes ranging from classical highbrow literature, to contemporary works including the graphic novel, to the profoundly modern and often irreverent sometimes found in social media, with a smattering of everything in between. Students will examine how a text addresses questions of audience and purpose and can expect to have the skills to apply these concepts to their own writing.
<br><br>
These goals will be achieved through play – literally and figuratively – as the course is designed to encourage experimentation with writing, student agency, unusual conceptions of what constitutes writing, gamifying learning, and even to encourage a willingness to fail in the pursuit of something new. Further, and in the spirit of play, this course will be adopting the lingo of games, because it is through play that we originally learned how to navigate the world, and I see no reason to change our natural predilections for learning. Ergo, assignments are called “quests”, points for assignments are “experience points (XP)”, and course sections become “Stages”, etc. Any and all jargon will be explained as the course progresses. <br>

Working with your group, create a presentation .<br><br>
<b>Requirements:</b><br>1) Show us what the platform can do<br>
<br>So for example,  PowerPoint lets us show slides, images, audio, animations, or embed video.
You will want to DEMONSTRATE THIS IN ACTION - so don't just list what it can do, show us an example (doesn't have to be original - if you can find an extant example somewhere online, that's fine.) 
<br><br>
2) Give us some brief instructions on how to use the program (or how to create the poster, in the case of Jasmine and Libby)<br><br>
This should be a very quick introduction to how to actually use the platform, e.g., if you were teaching us about PowerPoint you might show us how to create slides and put images/video on them. 
<br><br>
3) Identify what kinds of research would be well-suited/poor for this platform (e.g., if you were researching the paintings of Michelangelo, using a Podcast wouldn't be a great idea; if you were researching Beethoven's music, however, a Podcast would be perfect!)<br><br>

Musical lyrics are an oft-underappreciated form of writing, particularly in academia. So far, only Bob Dylan and Kendrick Lamar have been recognized as contributing to literature through their lyrics by the academic community at large. 
<br><br>
This is an optionally two part assignment. First, listen to any (or all) of the songs below, focusing on their lyrics. Write a one paragraph essay about any of them analyzing their lyrics and how they function in the song. Each paragraph you submit nets you ten points. 
<br><br>
Part Two: For each song you responded to, you may then offer your own suggestion based on the theme, musical, or literary quality of the song you listened to. Think of yourself as Spotify recommending a song based on what you listened to. Provide a link to the music and a paragraph explaining the lyrics of the song. Each paragraph you submit nets you ten points. 
<br><br>
If you respond to all five songs and recommend/analyze five you recommend, this quest is worth a possible total of up to 100 points.
<br><br>
In your response you should:<br>
1) Discuss the literal meaning of the song.<br>
2) Discuss any strong metaphors/figurative language.<br>
3) Discuss how the feel of the music contributes to the theme.<br><br>

The songs in question:<br>
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53sYL_VI89M"> Mos Def: Mathematics </a><br>
