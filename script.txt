Welcome to the class! I'll be setting up your avatars and experience bars post-haste
to allow you to better track your grades! If you don't already have the text books,
you might want to hit up the bookstore/library/Amazon/your preferred vendor of choice
and see if you can obtain a copy of the <i>Bedford Guide to Genre</i>.

<b>About the course:</b> In this course students will engage with traditional models of composition studies via genre and mode, and can expect a hands-on approach to grappling with the complexities of drafting, writing, proofreading, and revision. Students can expect to confront a variety of texts and writing themes ranging from classical highbrow literature, to contemporary works including the graphic novel, to the profoundly modern and often irreverent sometimes found in social media, with a smattering of everything in between. Students will examine how a text addresses questions of audience and purpose and can expect to have the skills to apply these concepts to their own writing.
<br><br>
These goals will be achieved through play – literally and figuratively – as the course is designed to encourage experimentation with writing, student agency, unusual conceptions of what constitutes writing, gamifying learning, and even to encourage a willingness to fail in the pursuit of something new. Further, and in the spirit of play, this course will be adopting the lingo of games, because it is through play that we originally learned how to navigate the world, and I see no reason to change our natural predilections for learning. Ergo, assignments are called “quests”, points for assignments are “experience points (XP)”, and course sections become “Stages”, etc. Any and all jargon will be explained as the course progresses. <br>
